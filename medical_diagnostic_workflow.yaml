scenario_name: Patient Data Processing and Alert System
domain: general
description: >
  This workflow processes unstructured medical records to extract structured patient data, analyze symptoms, check medication interactions, recommend treatments, generate medical disclaimers, and detect emergency conditions. It aims to streamline patient data management and enhance healthcare decision-making.

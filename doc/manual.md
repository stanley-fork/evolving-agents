# Running ai-os — a manual for what exists today

**[Español](es/manual.md)**

> **Read this first.** ai-os is four pillars and only one of them is a running
> product. This manual documents **what actually starts and what you can actually
> see**, verified by doing it on 2026-08-06 **[ran]**. Where a screenshot shows a
> feature, that feature runs. Where this manual says something does not exist, it
> does not exist — see [§ What you cannot run](#what-you-cannot-run).
>
> **The web interface in these screenshots is QM's, not ours.** `ai-ui` — the
> spatial canvas of [04-ai-ui](04-ai-ui.md) — is a specification with no code.
> What you see below is `ai-base`, the vendored upstream, doing its job.

## What you get

| Component | Runs? | What you can do with it |
|---|---|---|
| `ai-base` (QM) | **yes** | Full agent surface: chat, projects, files, crons, memory, skills |
| `ai-flows` | **partly** | Two libraries with CLIs — the observability instrument and the conformation projector. No flow engine |
| `ai-ui` | no | Specified in [04](04-ai-ui.md). No code |
| `ai-storage` | no | Specified in [05](05-ai-storage.md). No code |

## Part 1 · Start the platform

### Prerequisites

- Node 24+ (`ai-base/.node-version` pins it)
- An `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `ai-base/.env` — the default harness is `pi`, which
  is the one that reaches non-Anthropic models
- Postgres is **optional**. Without it everything falls back to in-memory stores,
  which is enough to run and has one consequence documented in Part 4

### 1.1 The core

The core is an API, not a web page. It refuses unsigned requests by default, so a
local run needs the escape hatch upstream provides for exactly this
(`src/api/server.ts:476`). Note the condition: the flag alone is not enough, the
signing secret must also be **absent**.

```bash
cd ai-os/ai-base
ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_CORE=1 ORG_ID=<your-org> PORT=8080 \
  HARNESS=pi OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<key> PI_MODEL=<model> \
  node src/index.ts
```

You want these two lines:

```
[server] ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_CORE=1 — HTTP ingress is UNAUTHENTICATED (intentionally isolated deployments only).
[qm] listening on :8080 (org=…, store=memory, runStore=memory, workers=16, backgroundWork=true)
```

> **This turns off authentication.** It is for a laptop and an isolated
> deployment. Do not do this anywhere reachable. With `CORE_SIGNING_SECRET` set
> instead, every request must carry an HMAC signature and you need the portal for
> a browser session.

### 1.2 The web surface

A **separate process**, in `plugins/web-ui`. Its sign-in mode is decided by one
line (`server/index.ts:36`): with no `CORE_SIGNING_SECRET` it uses a local cookie
and a dev sign-in form; with one, it expects the portal and a real identity
provider.

```bash
cd ai-os/ai-base/plugins/web-ui
npm install && npm run build
CORE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080 CORE_ORG_ID=<your-org> PORT=8096 \
  node server/index.ts
```

```
[web-ui] surface on http://localhost:8096 → core http://localhost:8080 (org …)
[web-ui] WEB_UI_PRINCIPALS unset — any principal id may sign in (dev only)
```

Open `http://localhost:8096`, type any principal id, and you are in.

<img src="assets/manual/01-chat.jpg" alt="" width="100%">

<sub>Signed in. The brown banner never lets you forget the instance is unauthenticated. Model and harness are pickable per turn — here DeepSeek V4 Flash on Pi.</sub>

---

## Part 2 · Projects are group scopes — see it yourself

This is the claim [ADR-0005](adr/0005-scale-is-scope.md) and
[12-conformation](12-conformation.md) rest on, and the UI proves it in its own
address bar.

Open **Projects → New project**, name it, and look at the URL:

<img src="assets/manual/03-project-scope.jpg" alt="" width="100%">

```
http://localhost:8096/contexts?scope=group%3Aweb-project-2dde0e2d-…
```

URL-decoded that is **`group:web-project-<uuid>`** — a `group` scope with a
reserved prefix, exactly as `projects/project-store.ts:47` builds it. There is no
"project" object anywhere. **The roster is the panel on the right** ("People · 1 ·
OWNER"), served by `ProjectStore`, and it is the *only* place membership lives.

<img src="assets/manual/02-projects.jpg" alt="" width="100%">

<sub>Every project is a scope; "Personal" is your `personal:` scope wearing a friendly name.</sub>

### An agent is a file, and the agent can write it

Ask the assistant, inside a project, to write `agents/reviewer.md`:

<img src="assets/manual/04-agent-written.jpg" alt="" width="100%">

<sub>Scoped to "Conformation Demo context" — the write lands in that project's workspace, not yours.</sub>

On disk:

```
ai-base/data/workspaces/group__web-project-2dde0e2d-…/agents/reviewer.md
```

That is the whole "per-project agents folder" feature. It is a directory in the
scope's workspace, and any agent that can write files can create one.

> **The catch, and it is not small.** Workspace-defined markdown agents are read
> by exactly one caller in the tree, `pi-tools.ts` **[read]**. On `claude` the
> child agents are hardcoded; on `codex` and `opencode` delegation happens inside
> their CLI. **Your `agents/` folder does nothing on three of five harnesses.**

---

## Part 3 · The multi-agent system

This is the part that changed most on 2026-08-07, and everything below was
verified by running it **[ran]**.

### Every level, its people, and its agents — one page

`ai-flows` serves a page at `GET /` showing the whole system: the levels the OS
actually has, who is in each, and the agents each scope defines.

```bash
cd ai-os/ai-flows
FLOWS_SIGNING_SECRET=<secret> node --env-file=/path/to/core.env scripts/serve.ts
# → http://localhost:8097
```

<img src="assets/manual/06-system-explorer.jpg" alt="" width="100%">

<sub>System first, because <code>global/</code> is mounted read-only into every scope below it.</sub>

#### Reading the colours

The page borrows its vocabulary from System 7 and Windows 3.1, and not for
nostalgia: those interfaces made **kind** and **state** visible before you read a
word. Every scope role, every agent, every step state has one colour used nowhere
else, and the page carries its own key — generated from the same table that
colours it, so it cannot drift from what it explains.

<img src="assets/manual/08-desktop-key.jpg" alt="" width="100%">

<sub>Point at a cube and you know what kind of thing it is. That is the whole idea.</sub>

**Nothing on the page is clickable**, and that is load-bearing rather than
unfinished. This page is the control arm for the canvas
([08-roadmap § Phase 2](08-roadmap.md)): anything it cannot do that you turn out
to need is evidence *for* building M5, and it is only evidence while nobody
quietly adds interaction here. The bar across the top carries facts, not menus,
for the same reason.

Read it top to bottom:

- **System** — `org:<your-org>`, whose `agents/` mount into every other scope as
  `global/agents/`.
- **Projects** — `group:web-project-<uuid>`, each with a **roster read from
  `ProjectStore`**. Membership is never read from a folder; see
  [ADR-0008](adr/0008-conformation-is-projected.md).
- **Groups & channels**, **Teams**, **Individuals** — the remaining scope kinds.

### Agents and sub-agents are markdown

An agent is `agents/<name>.md`. Frontmatter declares what it is; the body is its
system prompt:

```markdown
---
description: Owns the ledger rewrite. Splits work and routes it to the specialists.
tools: [read, write, execute]
subagents: [SchemaAgent, MigrationAgent, ReviewAgent]
---
You lead the ledger rewrite. Split the goal, route each piece to the agent in
your subagents list, and report what came back.
```

`description` and `tools` are upstream's. **`subagents:` is ours**, and it works
because upstream's parser validates those three fields and ignores every other
key — so the same file stays a valid, delegatable agent while carrying the tree.
There is no sidecar registry and no schema to keep in sync.

A declared name with no file renders struck through as **`declared, no file`**.
That is deliberate: a declared name is a claim, a file is a fact, and a tree that
renders a typo as a working composition is worse than no tree.

### Running a tree

`POST /flows/from-agent` turns the declared tree into a flow. Use `?dryRun=1`
first — a hand-declared tree is exactly the thing to look at before it spends
model calls.

```jsonc
POST /flows/from-agent?dryRun=1
{ "scopeId": "group:web-project-…", "agent": "LedgerLead", "goal": "add a currency column" }

// → step -> SchemaAgent     via:delegate depth:1
//   step -> MigrationAgent  via:delegate depth:1
//   step -> ReviewAgent     via:delegate depth:1
```

Drop `?dryRun=1` to create it, then `POST /flows/:id/advance` per step.

<img src="assets/manual/07-composed-flow.jpg" alt="" width="100%">

<sub>A composed flow in the in-tray, stopped at step 2. The strip under the goal is one cube per step — two green, one grey — so where it stopped is visible before you read anything.</sub>

The strip is there because `2/3 steps done` is a fact you have to read and three
cubes is a fact you see, and because the fraction throws away *which* steps are
unfinished. Work still moving sits in the **in-tray**; work that has settled sits
in the **out-tray**. "Where is this and is anyone holding it" is the question the
page exists to answer, so it is the question the layout answers first.

There is something else visible in that screenshot, and it is not a rendering
artefact. Step 0 delegated to `SchemaAgent`, which replied asking *which file
contains the ledger data* — it did no work — and the flow advanced to step 1
anyway. Every status on the card says the flow is fine. That is the degradation
[13-degradation](13-degradation.md) is about, on the page, in a real run.

### What composition does not do, and why

**Depth is flattened, not honoured.** A delegated child is built without
`runChild` (`pi-harness.ts:1313-1318`), so **an agent cannot delegate to its own
sub-agent**. What runs is the pattern llmunix's SystemAgent uses: the
orchestrating session reads the tree and delegates to each named agent itself. A
deeper tree contributes its descendants as further steps in the same flat
sequence, and the plan says so rather than leaving you to notice.

**A system agent cannot be delegated to from a project.** `delegate` resolves
`agents/<name>.md` against the scope's own root; the system scope mounts at
`global/` and agent names cannot contain `/`. The composer marks those steps
`inline` — the instructions are pasted into the step instead. That is strictly
worse (no isolated context, no tool narrowing) and it is labelled so nobody reads
an inlined step as a delegated one.

### Two write paths, and using the wrong one fails silently

The single most useful thing in this manual, because getting it wrong produces a
page that renders perfectly and a runtime that finds nothing:

| Layer | Materialised from | Write agents with |
|---|---|---|
| `global/` — the org scope, read-only | the `WorkspaceStore`, **rebuilt every turn** | `workspace.write()`. It is also the **only** way: `scopeFor` returns `personal`, `group` or `channel` and never `org`, so no conversation can reach the system scope |
| your own scope, read-write | the **persisted sandbox** | a **turn** — ask the agent to `write` the file |

`ro-layers.ts` opens with `if (layer.mode === "rw") continue;`. Measured: after
writing six agent files to the store for a project scope, `ls -1 agents/` inside
that scope's sandbox returned **two**, and a seventh written and listed a minute
later never appeared. Materialisation runs sandbox → store, not the reverse.

`scripts/seed-demo.ts` builds the whole demonstration above — system agents,
project, roster, trees — using the correct path for each layer.

```bash
node --env-file=/path/to/core.env scripts/seed-demo.ts
```

### One thing that is a stopgap, and is not pretending otherwise

A shared scope refuses a turn from a non-member, and **a flow records no actor** —
it has a `scopeId` and nothing about who it acts for. `FLOWS_ACTOR` names one
principal who must be a member of every scope the server runs flows in. It is
wrong the way shared service accounts are always wrong: every flow in the audit
log is attributed to the same person regardless of who asked for it.

This is [ADR-0008](adr/0008-conformation-is-projected.md)'s condition for agent
principals firing — *an agent that must appear in a roster* — and it is recorded
rather than papered over.

---

## Part 4 · The conformation projector

The one thing in `ai-flows` you can point at a real system. It answers *what shape
is this system in, and who has been talking to whom* — read-only, no writes, no
tables.

```bash
cd ai-os/ai-flows
node --env-file-if-exists=../ai-base/.env scripts/conformation-probe.ts --data ../ai-base/data
```

Against the instance from Part 2:

```
conformation @ 2026-08-06T21:15:09Z  harness=pi  digest=a197a05cbf3dfcbf

project    group:web-project-2dde0e2d-0b07-4554-8bef-353f7c8400e7
  agent  reviewer [read] Reviews a change against project policy.
system     org:evolvingagents
individual personal:matias
  memory MEMORY.md

holes (3) — these are the deliverable:
  [-] Which scopes exist?
  [group:web-project-…] Who is on this project's roster?
  [-] Who has been talking to whom?
```

Flags: `--json` for the document instead of the rendering, `--seed` to write a
fixture first, `--converse` to run two real turns so the graph has edges.

### Holes are the point

A projection's failure mode is silence — a view that renders cleanly because it
did not ask. So every unanswerable question is printed. **Read the holes first;
they are more informative than the tree.**

---

<a id="holes-live"></a>

## Part 5 · What the holes told us, running it live

Three findings from the exact run above, and they are the reason this manual is
worth more than a feature list.

**The roster hole is correct, and the UI proves it.** The screenshot in Part 2
shows "People · 1 · OWNER". The projector says it cannot see the roster. Both are
true: with `store=memory` the `ProjectStore` lives *inside the running core's
process*, so a second process reading the same `dataDir` sees the workspace files
and none of the state. **Run Postgres if you want conformation across processes.**

**A project can exist with no workspace at all.** Immediately after creation the
projector could not see the project — the directory materialises only when a turn
writes something. Scope enumeration is a session fact, not a workspace fact, and
no store answers it directly.

**Attribution had to be rebuilt.** `meta.author` is written from
`actor.displayName` and nothing else (`core/orchestrator.ts:2170`), so turns from
a surface that supplies no display name — and **every reply the assistant makes** —
are unattributed. `ai-flows` recovers this from participant windows: 4 of 4 on the
measured pair, with the principal id rather than the display name
([12-conformation](12-conformation.md#attribution-recovered)).

---

## Part 6 · The desk — flows as documents, agents as cubes

`ai-ui` is a third process. It reads the system from `ai-flows` and owns nothing
but the arrangement.

```bash
cd ai-os/ai-ui
DATABASE_URL=<same as the flow API> FLOWS_API_URL=http://localhost:8097 \
  node scripts/serve.ts
# → http://localhost:8098
```

<img src="assets/manual/09-desk.jpg" alt="" width="100%">

<sub>Two flows, one finished and one not started. The cubes on each document are the agents with work in it; <code>LedgerLead</code> sits on bare desk because it has none. <code>AnomalyScanner</code> is on the shelf, struck through: declared in <code>DataQualityAgent.md</code> with no file behind it, so it cannot be dragged anywhere.</sub>

**A document is a flow. A cube is an agent.** A cube resting on a document means
that agent has work in that flow, and the strip under the goal is one cube per
step, so where a flow stopped is visible before you read anything.

### The four gestures, and what each costs

| Gesture | What happens | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Drag a document | It stays there, for that scope, across reloads | nothing |
| Drop a cube on a document | That agent gets a **real step** — the same instruction composing a tree writes | nothing to add it |
| Drag a cube off | That agent's **queued steps are removed** | nothing |
| Click a document → **Advance** | Runs one step | **one model call** |

Dragging a cube off is the part worth explaining. Dropping one creates work, so
taking it off has to undo the same work — otherwise the desk would show an agent
as idle while its step sat queued and ready to run. **A step that has already
started is not removed**: an attempt is history, and the desk says so and puts
the cube back rather than drawing a picture that is wrong.

<img src="assets/manual/10-desk-panel.jpg" alt="" width="100%">

<sub>Selecting a document opens its panel: every step by agent, and the one control that spends money — with the cost stated before it is pressed. A document is addressable: <code>?select=&lt;flowId&gt;</code>.</sub>

### The trace: what actually happened

A document's panel has two faces. **State** answers *where is this*. **Trace**
answers *what happened*, and it is the face this whole system exists for.

<img src="assets/manual/11-trace-memory.jpg" alt="" width="100%">

<sub>The Trace face of a document, from a live instance, and the memory drawer below it. Every step with its result, its attempt, its run and the observation digest captured when that attempt closed — plus the movement verdict, quoted with the bound it is read under.</sub>

Everything on that face is **measured**, not summarised:

- **`progressing` · `3 observations · δ ≤ 14.6%`** — the movement verdict from
  [10-observability](10-observability.md), computed by the same
  `observabilityOf` the explorer uses. Below two observations it says *not enough
  to say* rather than rounding to "fine", because a repeat is proof and a
  difference is a rumour.
- **The digest under each attempt** is what that verdict is made of. It is
  captured when the attempt closes and never inferred
  ([ADR-0007](adr/0007-observation-captured-not-derived.md)).
- **A step that used nothing it was given** is flagged in red with the numbers
  behind the flag — how much of the input it carried, and how many distinctive
  tokens there were to carry. That is [13-degradation](13-degradation.md)'s
  headline, and every other signal on the card says the flow is fine.

The screenshot has one of its own. Step 2's `ReviewAgent` reports that it
*"couldn't access the files due to sandbox isolation, but I have both files in
context so I'll do the review directly."* It reviewed from memory. Nothing about
the flow's state says so — the step is green, the flow is `done`, the strip is
full. **It is legible only in the trace**, which is the argument for the trace
being on the canvas rather than one page away.

### Memory: a drawing of software that does not exist

<sub><strong>NOT BUILT — THIS IS THE SPEC.</strong> The drawer along the bottom is hatched and every card is dashed, and it says so on the object rather than in a footnote.</sub>

`ai-storage` is [05](05-ai-storage.md) and nothing else. There is no store, no
promotion, no consolidation. What the drawer shows is a note **recomputed from
the traces on every read** — a memory that vanishes when you stop looking is not
one, and that is exactly why it is drawn as a sketch.

It is here because a picture is a cheaper specification than a document, and an
interactive one is cheaper still: you find out what "promote a flow's notes into
the project" needs by trying to press the button.

The shape it commits to:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Four levels** | `system` · `user` · `project` · `flow`, longest-lived first, from doc/05 |
| **Promotion is one rung** | flow → project → user → system, explicit and reversible |
| **Provenance is required** | every note names the flows it came from; a note nobody can trace back is indistinguishable from one somebody typed |
| **Consolidation keeps what carried** | the steps that moved something forward survive; the ones flagged as carrying nothing are dropped |

That last row is the cheap insight and the reason this is not a port. The hard
part of consolidation — *which steps of a trace mattered* — is the question
`contribution.ts` already answers. `evolving-memory` calls it `TraceCurator`;
here it already runs on every flow.

**What the sketch does not answer**, and the real one must: when two notes say
the same thing, which survives? That is why consolidation cannot simply be a loop
over finished flows.

### Reading the desk never starts work

The page re-reads state every five seconds. Nothing about that can launch a step:
`/assign` writes one and `/advance` runs one, and both are gestures you make.

It *does* collect. A step whose run has finished has to be settled by something,
and if the desk only ever advanced, a step it started would sit at `running`
forever. **Measured, by pressing the button:** the first version left a step
running for over ten minutes with its run long finished, and the agent's cube
pulsing over it. Collecting launches nothing and spends nothing — it settles a
run already paid for.

### When every step is done but the flow is not

A flow whose steps have all settled stays `waiting` until something closes it.
The panel offers **Mark the flow finished** in that case, and says plainly that
it spends nothing, because there is no step left to run.

---

## What you cannot run

Stated plainly, because a manual that omits this is a brochure:

- **The flow engine is built; the shapes above it are not.** M2 was delivered on
  2026-08-06 — a flow started by one process and finished by another, 6/6 on both
  `pi` and `mock` ([08-roadmap § M2](08-roadmap.md)). What is still absent is
  everything above one shape: no `Sequence`, `Loop`, `Fan-out`, `Deliberation` or
  `Watch`, and no merge.
- **The canvas is built but unproven.** Part 6 is real and runs. What has *not*
  happened is its own falsification: the stopwatch, a three-day-old flow somebody
  else ran, desk against transcript ([04](04-ai-ui.md)). Until that is run, the
  honest claim is that it works, not that it helps.
- **There is no scoped memory.** `ai-storage` is [05](05-ai-storage.md) and
  nothing else. The `Memory` tab you see is QM's flat `MEMORY.md`.
- **Orchestrator agents still cannot have their own sub-agents.** Delegation is
  capped at one level, deliberately, in one line (`pi-harness.ts:1313-1318`). A
  declared tree is composition the *session* executes, flattened — see Part 3.
- **Agents are not principals.** `PrincipalType = "internal" | "guest"`. An agent
  cannot be on a roster or hold its own permissions.

## Shutting down

```bash
pkill -f "src/index.ts"          # core
pkill -f "web-ui/server/index.ts"  # surface
```

In-memory stores mean everything except workspace files disappears with the
process. That is a configuration choice, not a defect — set `DATABASE_URL` to keep
it.

"""The doc illustrations, as a script rather than four orphan files.

    projects/coclea-sr/.venv/bin/python doc/assets/make-illustrations.py

Documents 00–14 each carry a header illustration; 15–18 did not, and the gap was
recorded in [18 §8](../18-from-a-hypothesis-to-a-therapeutic-surface.md) rather
than quietly dropped. This closes it, and closes it as a **generator** so the
next document does not reopen it.

## The house style, measured from the existing files rather than guessed

`12-conformation.jpg`, `13-degradation.jpg` and `14-review-study.jpg` were
sampled pixel-by-pixel to recover the palette below. Nothing here is a designer's
opinion about what the series looks like; it is what the series is.

* **1400 × 594**, the size every existing plate uses.
* **No text.** Not one of the fourteen has a word in it, and a caption belongs in
  the document where it can be corrected.
* Near-black ground, cream strokes for the ordinary thing, **teal** for a
  container that is fine, **amber** for the one that is different, **red** only
  for something that failed.
* One idea per plate, expressed geometrically. If a plate needs a legend it is
  the wrong plate.

## What each one says

* **15** — semantic zoom: the same object, revealed at more detail as you look
  closer, and a fork that is recorded rather than lost.
* **16** — the oracle is **outside** the work. The reference line never touches
  the chain of steps; the one red step is red because of a comparison, not
  because of how it looked.
* **17** — a project born empty, staffed, and furnished — with one agent
  **declared and struck through**, because a declared name is a claim and a file
  is a fact.
* **18** — the arc. A trajectory that decays and stops (amber, ending red), and a
  second one that propagates on a base the first did not have and opens into the
  seven signatures, one of them open because it is a posit.

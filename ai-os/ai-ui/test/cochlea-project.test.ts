/**
 * The scope's second claim, and the one that needed a new check.
 *
 * `cochlea-demo.test.ts` guards the first claim — the demo's eigenvalues must
 * not drift from the Python suite's. This file guards the claim that the demo
 * makes about **memory**: that an index can pass every mechanical check the
 * product has and still be wrong about the project, because a corpus of
 * decisions has a time axis and the notes do not.
 *
 * A demo that asserted that without being able to demonstrate it would be
 * telling a story. So the load-bearing test here is the falsifiability one:
 * link the note to its successor and the check goes green. If it did not, the
 * red result would be a decoration rather than a measurement.

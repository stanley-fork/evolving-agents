/**
 * Where everything sits on the desk, and who decides.
 *
 * This is the module [04-ai-ui](../../doc/04-ai-ui.md) is actually about. The
 * canvas has four claimed properties — spatial, live, generated, steerable — and
 * three of them are rendering. **Generated** is the one with a hard problem in
 * it, and the problem is not "compute a layout": it is *what happens to the
 * layout the user made when the system wants to propose a new one.*
 *
 * The rule, from that document, is one sentence:
 *
 * > The system proposes on state change; **it never re-arranges what the user
 * > has touched.**
 *
 * So every placement carries a `pinned` bit, set the moment a human drags it,
 * and `propose()` is written to route around pinned things rather than to
 * overwrite them. A canvas that forgets this is not "slightly annoying" — it is
 * a canvas that throws away the user's work every time an agent finishes a step,
 * which is precisely when they are looking at it.
 *
 * ## What a cube is, and why it can sit on a document
 *
 * A **document** is a flow. A **cube** is an agent. A cube sitting *on* a
 * document means that agent has work in that flow, and several cubes on one
 * document **stack** — which is the agent tree, made of objects you can point at
 * rather than an indented list.
 *
 * That is also why dropping a cube on a document is an instruction and not a
 * view change: it means *give this agent a step in this flow*. Direct
 * manipulation is an input, which is the fourth property, and it is the reason
 * this module models placement rather than just remembering coordinates.
 *
 * Pure and storage-free on purpose: no fetch, no DOM, no clock. The hard rule
 * above is a property of a function here, so it can be tested as one.

/**
 * Lay the desk out from the current state, preserving everything the user placed.

 * Three rules, in order, and the order is the whole design:
 *
 * 1. **A pinned placement is copied through untouched.** Not "usually", not
 *    "unless it collides" — untouched. A user who drags a document somewhere odd
 *    meant it; the system does not get a vote.
 * 2. **A pinned cube keeps its `onDoc`.** Dragging a cube onto a document is an
 *    assertion about the work, and re-deriving `onDoc` from the flow's steps
 *    would silently undo an assignment the moment it was made — before the step
 *    it created had run.
 * 3. Everything unpinned is arranged from state: documents into a grid over the
 *    free slots, cubes stacked on the documents whose flows name them, leftovers
 *    parked on the shelf.
 *
 * Deleted things are dropped rather than kept: a layout that accumulates
 * placements for flows that no longer exist grows without bound and eventually
 * reserves grid slots for nothing.

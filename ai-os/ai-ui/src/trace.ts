/**
 * What actually happened, as opposed to what is scheduled to happen.
 *
 * The desk shipped a flow's *skeleton* — how many steps, which agent, what state
 * — and stopped there. That is enough to answer "where is this", which is what a
 * canvas is usually for, and it is not enough to answer the question this whole
 * system exists to answer: **what happened, and should I change the agents?**
 *
 * The two instruments built for that read attempts and observations:
 *
 *   - `contributionsOf` finds a step that ran, settled, reported — and used
 *     nothing it was handed ([13-degradation](../../doc/13-degradation.md)).
 *   - `observabilityOf` reads the fingerprints of successive attempts and says
 *     whether the flow is moving, repeating itself, or too quiet to tell
 *     ([10-observability](../../doc/10-observability.md)).
 *
 * Neither reached the canvas, because neither's input did. This module carries
 * them across, and it **reuses the modules rather than reimplementing them**: a
 * second copy of "is this drifting" is a second answer to it, and the one on the
 * screen would be the one nobody tested.
 *
 * ## This is real, not simulated
 *
 * Every field here comes from the flow store. Memory (`memory.ts`) is the
 * opposite and says so loudly. Keeping the two apart matters more than either:
 * a surface that mixes measured state with a sketch of state teaches its reader
 * to trust both equally.

   * `ai-flows`' store has recorded `Attempt.startedAt` and `Attempt.finishedAt`
   * since the beginning. This projection dropped both — so every surface built
   * on it had **no clock at all**, and "the desk has no time axis" was not a
   * limit of the data. It was a lossy projection between the store and the
   * screen, and nothing failed when it happened.
   *
   * That is the more expensive kind of gap: the desk laid documents out in a
   * grid because it had no other option available *to it*, while the answer sat
   * one hop upstream. `threads.ts` needs a real clock, and this is where it was.
   *
   * `null` when the store has none — never inferred, never filled in with the
   * flow's `updatedAt` or with anything else. A surface that draws a duration
   * from a guessed timestamp is drawing a measurement it did not take.

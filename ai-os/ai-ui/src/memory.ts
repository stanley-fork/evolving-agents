/**
 * Memory on the desk — **a drawing of software that does not exist.**
 *
 * `ai-storage` is [05](../../doc/05-ai-storage.md) and nothing else: four levels
 * with different lifetimes, and promotion between them that is explicit,
 * recorded and reversible. None of it is built. There is no store, no promotion,
 * no consolidation.
 *
 * So why draw it at all? Because a picture is a cheaper specification than a
 * document, and a *interactive* picture is cheaper still — you find out that
 * "promote a flow into project memory" needs a reason field by trying to press
 * the button, not by reviewing a schema. This module exists to be argued with
 * and then thrown away, and the thing that replaces it should be able to reuse
 * the shape rather than the code.
 *
 * ## The rule this module lives under
 *
 * **Everything here is marked, in the UI, as not built.** Not in a footnote — on
 * the object. A surface that mixes measured state with a sketch of state teaches
 * whoever reads it to trust both equally, and the trustworthy half is the one
 * that loses. `trace.ts` is the opposite of this file: every field there comes
 * from the flow store.
 *
 * ## Where the shape comes from
 *
 * The four levels are doc/05's. The consolidation step — many traces in, fewer
 * reusable notes out — is the job the two seeded system agents already name
 * (`MemoryAnalysisAgent`, `MemoryConsolidationAgent`, inherited from llmunix)
 * and the one `evolving-memory` implements as a dream cycle. Its `TraceCurator`
 * decides which steps of a trace mattered, which is the question
 * `contribution.ts` already answers here — so the cheap version of consolidation
 * is not a port, it is: **keep the steps that carried something forward, drop
 * the ones that did not.**

/**
 * The menu that reveals itself — proposed actions for *this* object, in *this*
 * state.
 *
 * A command line asks you to remember the verb. A menu bar shows you the verbs,
 * and that is most of what made a GUI usable by people who had never used a
 * computer. Agent systems went back to the command line: the interface is a text
 * box, and knowing what to type is the whole skill.
 *
 * The set of sensible things to do with a flow is not fixed, which is why nobody
 * has drawn it as a menu — it depends on the flow's state, its trace, and what
 * just failed. So this module derives it. Each proposal carries **the evidence
 * that produced it**, because an action offered without a reason is a guess the
 * user has to audit, and auditing a guess is slower than deciding unaided.
 *
 * ## Deterministic first, model second — and the order is the safety property
 *
 * Every proposal here is computed from state. A model may add to the list
 * ([projection.ts](projection.ts) holds the result, generated on state change so
 * a render never spends), and what it adds is marked `source: "model"` and
 * **appended, never substituted**. Three consequences, all deliberate:
 *
 *   - The desk works with no model at all, which is what makes the arrangement
 *     testable and what keeps the demo honest.
 *   - A model that returns nothing degrades to a shorter menu, not an empty one.
 *   - A model that returns something wrong is visibly a proposal from a model,
 *     next to proposals that are not.
 *
 * ## Cost is on the proposal, not in a preference
 *
 * `04-ai-ui` requires that anything spending a model call says so before it is
 * pressed. So `spends` is a field on every action rather than something the panel
 * decides how to render. An action that cannot state its cost is not offerable.

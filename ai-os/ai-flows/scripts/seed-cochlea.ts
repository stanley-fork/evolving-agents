/**
 * Seed the cochlea lab as a real project on a running instance, and run it.
 *
 *   cd ai-flows && DATA_DIR=... DATABASE_URL=... \
 *     node --env-file=../ai-base/.env scripts/seed-cochlea.ts
 *
 * This is the arm of `projects/coclea-sr/` that the browser demo simulates: the
 * same eight agents, declared as markdown in a project scope, reasoning over the
 * **actual gate reports** the Python suite produced.
 *
 * ## What is real here and what is not — stated up front
 *
 * **Real:** the project and its scope, the agent files (written through a turn
 * and read back from the store, never trusted to the model's reply), the gate
 * report data, the flow, its steps, and the model calls that advance them.
 *
 * **Not real:** the agents do not *run* pytest. `execute` reaches the sandbox
 * workspace, which is not the checkout `projects/coclea-sr/` lives in, so the
 * numbers are carried in as data rather than produced in-loop. Mounting the
 * project into the sandbox is the next step and is not this script.
 *
 * Saying which half is which matters more than the demo looking complete. A seed
 * that implies the gates ran inside the loop would be claiming the one thing
 * that has not happened yet.
 *
 * ## Why the files are written through a turn
 *
 * `ro-layers.ts` materialises read-only layers only, so a `workspace.write()`
 * into a group scope is visible to the conformation view and **invisible to
 * `delegate`**. `seed-demo.ts` documents the measurement: six files written to
 * the store, two visible in the sandbox. Project files go through a turn; the
 * read-back is what decides whether they landed.

   * found no measured value for seven of the eight gates and correctly called

   * **FREEZE**, quoting `mayFreeze: true`. Two agents, one file, opposite

   * Handing a verifier the answer it exists to derive is the same defect as a
   * gate that cannot fail. So the summary now carries **evidence and no
   * verdict**: per gate, every check with its measured quantity, so a green
   * claim has a number behind it and the freeze decision has to be made from

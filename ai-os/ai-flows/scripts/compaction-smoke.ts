/**
 * The [ran] for M2's other half of deliverable 3: **a flow survives context
 * compaction**, not just a process restart.
 *
 * Restart and compaction fail differently. A restart destroys the process and
 * leaves the database intact; compaction leaves the process alone and rewrites
 * the *session* underneath a step — entries are summarised and replaced, and a
 * step holding a `sessionId` can find the conversation it was executing in
 * materially changed. Proving one says nothing about the other.
 *
 * Compaction fires at `MAX_CONTEXT_ENTRIES = 400` or `MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS = 120k`
 * (`core/orchestrator/compaction.ts`), both hardcoded. So rather than configure
 * it, this drives a thread past the entry ceiling and then runs a flow step in
 * that same thread:
 *
 *   1. fill one thread with enough plain turns to cross 400 entries
 *   2. confirm from the session's own record that compaction actually happened —
 *      if it did not, the run proves nothing and says so rather than passing
 *   3. run a flow whose step executes in that compacted thread
 *   4. check the step settled, carried its reply, and kept its observation
 *
 * Step 2 is the guard that matters. Without it this is a slow way to run one
 * flow step and call it a compaction test.
 *
 *   cd ai-flows && CORE_API_URL=http://localhost:8081 \
 *     node --env-file=/path/to/mock-core.env scripts/compaction-smoke.ts
 *
 * Intended for `HARNESS=mock`: 400+ entries against a real model is a bill, and
 * compaction is a property of the session layer rather than of the model.

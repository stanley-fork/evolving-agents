/**
 * Family B's headroom pre-check: does the handoff actually lose anything?
 *
 * The control arm only. Each task runs twice against the real model and sandbox: an
 * explorer computes an intermediate and writes a note, then a finisher — in a
 * DIFFERENT conversation, sharing the same workspace — must finish from that note
 * alone. Nothing accumulates, no strategy is supplied.
 *
 * If `handoffLoss` comes back near zero, the explorer is spontaneously recording
 * everything a successor needs, there is no trap to learn, and the treatment arm must
 * not be built until the split is redesigned. That is the same gate the atomic suite
 * just failed, applied before the money is spent rather than after.
 *
 * **Two conversations rather than two delegated children, deliberately.** Delegation
 * works now (`delegate-smoke.ts` is [ran]) and would be the more lifelike shape, but it
 * leaks: the parent composes the child's task string and could restate everything the
 * note omitted, so the note would stop being the only channel. Here the finisher's
 * prompt is fixed by this script, identical in both arms, and the note is the only
 * thing that varies. Measuring the mechanism beats dramatising it.
 *
 * The distinction that makes the number mean anything: a finisher that cannot find the
 * file at all is an infrastructure failure, not a lost handoff, and is counted
 * separately. Conflating them would let a scope bug masquerade as evidence.
 *

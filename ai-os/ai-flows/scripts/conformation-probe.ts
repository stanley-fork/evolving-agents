/**
 * The [ran] for the conformation projector.
 *
 * `src/conformation.ts` takes ports and is proven against fixtures. That proves
 * the projection and proves nothing about whether the base will answer the
 * questions. This wires it to real `ai-base` stores and reports what came back —
 * including, and especially, what did not.
 *
 *   cd ai-flows && node --env-file-if-exists=../ai-base/.env scripts/conformation-probe.ts
 *   ... --json           emit the document instead of the rendering
 *   ... --data <dir>     read an existing dataDir rather than the configured one
 *   ... --seed           write a small fixture first, so the probe has something to see
 *
 * Two limits of the base are known before running. They are wired as holes
 * rather than worked around, because working around them is how a projection
 * starts flattering itself:
 *
 *   1. Scope enumeration is a SESSION fact, not a workspace one.
 *      `WorkspaceStore` has `list(scopeId)` and nothing that lists scope ids
 *      (`workspace-store.ts:6-14`), so a scope is discoverable only once it has
 *      held a session — `SessionStore.distinctScopes()`. A scope with a
 *      materialised workspace and no conversation is invisible, and that is
 *      reported rather than hidden.
 *   2. `ProjectStore` has `listForMember(principalId)` and no list-all, so
 *      projects are found only through scopes that already surfaced in (1).
 *
 * Both are properties of the base, not of the projector. Stating them is the
 * point: ADR-0008 asks for the holes as output.

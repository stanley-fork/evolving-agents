/**
 * The flow engine — M2's first slice.
 *
 * One flow, one shape (`open`), steps that execute as real runs through the
 * signed HTTP seam. This is the piece [08-roadmap](../../doc/08-roadmap.md)
 * calls "the one that justifies the repository", and everything it does is
 * arranged around one requirement: **a flow started on Monday resumes on
 * Wednesday, after a restart, with its state intact.**
 *
 * ## Why the order of operations is what it is
 *
 * The obvious sequence — open the attempt, then launch the run — cannot be
 * resumed. `startAttempt` takes the `runId` at open time and there is no way to
 * attach one later, so an attempt opened before the turn is queued is an attempt
 * that says `running` with `runId: null`, and a process restarting on Wednesday
 * cannot tell whether a run was ever launched. It would have to choose between
 * abandoning work that may be finishing and duplicating work that already ran.
 *
 * So the turn is queued **first** and the attempt records its `runId` at open:
 *
 *     queueTurn -> runId -> startAttempt({ runId }) -> awaitRun -> finishAttempt
 *
 * The cost is a real window: a crash between `queueTurn` and `startAttempt`
 * leaves a run executing in the core with no attempt pointing at it. That run is
 * orphaned, the step retries, and the work is done twice. **That is the trade
 * being made** — a bounded duplicate is recoverable, an ambiguous attempt is not.
 * `resume()` below is what makes the choice pay off.
 *
 * ## Nothing here retries
 *
 * A failed attempt stays failed and its step stays `failed`. Retrying is the
 * caller's decision because `startAttempt` opens attempt *n+1* and keeps the
 * prior one — failure is history, not an overwrite ([03](../../doc/03-ai-flows.md)).
 * An engine that silently retried would collapse that history into a success.

/**
 * What shape is this system in, and who has been talking to whom?
 *
 * An operating system lets you see itself: the process list, the filesystem, who
 * is logged in. ai-os could answer none of those about itself. The information
 * exists — scopes, project rosters, workspace agent files, the session tape —
 * and nothing projected it.
 *
 * This module projects it, and the design rule is the whole point:
 *
 *   **Conformation is READ. It is never stored.**
 *
 * The tempting alternative was a folder hierarchy — `users/` inside each project,
 * `agents/` beside it, `subagents/` under each orchestrator. Six of those seven
 * structures already exist as the layered workspace and upstream's `ProjectStore`
 * (doc/12-conformation.md). The seventh, `users/`, is the one that must never be
 * built: it is an ACL that no ACL function reads, and it diverges from the roster
 * the moment someone is removed. ADR-0005 rejected that object one layer up;
 * ADR-0008 rejects it here.
 *
 * So this module reads membership from the roster port and, if it finds a
 * membership-shaped file sitting in a workspace, reports it as a FINDING rather
 * than believing it. See `membershipInFolders`.
 *
 * ## Holes are output
 *
 * The failure mode of any projection is silence: a view that renders cleanly
 * because it did not ask is worse than no view. Every question this module asks
 * and cannot answer becomes a `Hole` in the result, and the holes are the
 * deliverable — they are the evidence for whether any new folder is needed at
 * all. A run that returns no holes falsifies the case for building anything.
 *
 * ## Nothing here imports ai-base
 *
 * Per ADR-0006, `ai-flows/src` imports nothing from core; it takes ports. In
 * particular `parseAgent` is injected rather than reimplemented, so an agent file
 * is parsed by upstream's own `parseAgentDefinition` and this module cannot drift
 * from the contract it is describing. `scripts/` does the wiring.

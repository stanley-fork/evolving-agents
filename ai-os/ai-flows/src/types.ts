/**
 * `gated` is the first shape that declares a metric.
 *
 * [16-a-workload-with-an-oracle](../../doc/16-a-workload-with-an-oracle.md)
 * argued for it from a measured need rather than from the list in `doc/03`: a
 * workload with an **external oracle** — closed-form eigenvalues that a module
 * forbidden to import the solver produces — can say whether a step was right,
 * and `open` cannot. A `gated` flow names the checks it must satisfy and
 * **cannot reach `done` while one of them is red or has never run**.
 *
 * That is spec §6.1 of `projects/coclea-sr`, eval-gated freeze, in the OS's own
 * vocabulary: no artefact becomes frozen until every applicable gate is green.

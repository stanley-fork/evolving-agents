/**
 * Is a flow's progress readable from what it records?
 *
 * Every "it stopped moving" claim is a claim that two states are the same, and
 * that claim is only as good as the instrument making it. Model
 * non-determinism means identical work does not always produce an identical
 * fingerprint, so the instrument has a false-change rate, and it has to be
 * measured before anything is inferred from it.
 *
 * The comparison is a Z-channel, not a symmetric one:
 *
 *   state unchanged  ──(1-δ)──▶  digest equal
 *                    ──( δ )──▶  digest different      ← noise
 *   state changed    ──( 1 )──▶  digest different
 *
 * Digest equality is proof; digest difference is a rumour. That asymmetry is
 * the whole design: the failure this module exists to catch is not a false
 * alarm, it is the silent one — a stuck flow whose fingerprint keeps moving.
 *
 * Nothing here consumes a flow's state. It reports; the engine decides.

/**
 * The default fingerprint, and it normalizes before hashing. **[ran]**
 *
 * Measured on `pi` / `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`, 22 turns of repeated identical
 * work: δ was 21.1% pooled over the raw text and **0% once normalized**. Every
 * observed divergence was presentation — in the worst group, the model returned
 * `src/types.ts` three times and `` `src/types.ts` `` five times. Backticks alone
 * drove that group's raw δ to 53.6%, which is enough noise to hide half the stuck
 * flows in the window.
 *
 * So casing, punctuation and spacing are stripped: they are the part the model is
 * free to vary without the state having changed, and a fingerprint that counts
 * them is measuring prose style rather than work.
 *
 * This is a floor, not a ceiling. A caller with something better — the set of
 * files touched, a structured result — should fingerprint that and say so in
 * `Observation.source`. See doc/10-observability.md § What was measured.

/**
 * The signed HTTP seam to `ai-base`.
 *
 * [ADR-0006](../../doc/adr/0006-ai-flows-lives-outside-core.md) decided that
 * `ai-flows` advances a step by calling the core's public API rather than by
 * importing it, on the argument that the route table already exposes create,
 * advance, inspect, steer and abort. That decision has been standing since
 * 2026-08-02 with **nobody writing the client it requires**, which made it the
 * first real task of M2 rather than a detail of it.
 *
 * ## Why the canonical string is duplicated rather than imported
 *
 * `ai-flows/src` imports nothing from `ai-base` — that is the whole content of
 * ADR-0006, and importing the signer "just for the format" would quietly make
 * this package depend on core again. So the format is restated here:
 *
 *     v0:{unix-seconds}:{METHOD}\n{path-with-query}\n{body}
 *     HMAC-SHA256, hex, prefixed `v0=`
 *     headers: x-timestamp, x-signature
 *
 * Duplication is only safe if something checks it. `test/core-client.test.ts`
 * pins the exact bytes against a known vector, and `scripts/flow-smoke.ts`
 * proves it against a real signed core — because a signature format that has
 * drifted fails as a 401 with no hint about which half is wrong.
 *
 * ## The five-minute window is the caller's problem too
 *
 * Upstream rejects a timestamp more than five minutes from its own clock
 * (`SOURCE_AUTH_REPLAY_WINDOW_MS`). A flow that resumes on Wednesday signs at
 * Wednesday's clock, so this is not a durability concern — but a queued request
 * held longer than the window is, and that is why `signedFetch` stamps at call
 * time rather than at construction.

/**
 * Deixis — the question that says "this".
 *
 * A chat box has no pronouns. To ask about a step you have to describe it in
 * words, which means knowing enough about it to describe it, which is most of
 * what you were trying to find out. A canvas has selection, and **selection is
 * the pronoun**: the object is already identified, so the question can be three
 * words long.
 *
 * That is the whole of what this module enables, and it is why the interesting
 * part is not the model call — it is what gets put in front of the question.
 *
 * ## The answer comes from the trace, never from the goal
 *
 * The failure mode is specific and it is seductive. A flow's `goal` is
 * well-written prose that describes what was *intended*; its attempts are the
 * messy record of what *happened*. A model handed both will answer from the goal,
 * because the goal reads like an answer — and it will be fluent, plausible and
 * about work that was never done.
 *
 * So the context is built from attempts, states, observations and errors. The
 * goal appears once, labelled as intent, and the instruction says which one to
 * trust when they disagree.
 *
 * ## It has to be able to say "the trace does not show that"
 *
 * A step with no attempts contains no evidence. Answering anyway is the
 * confidently-wrong failure this repository keeps finding in its own
 * instruments, so the prompt names the refusal as an acceptable answer and
 * `evidenceCount` lets the caller see how much there was to work with. A
 * question asked against zero observations should be answered by the desk, not
 * by a model.

/**
 * The capacity claim, measured.
 *
 * doc/05's standing rule is that no memory axis ships without a benchmark the
 * baseline could lose, named before the axis is built. The benchmark named in
 * [wiki.ts](../src/wiki.ts) is **capacity**: at what corpus size does the thing
 * the model must read stop fitting the window?
 *
 * The baseline — one flat file of everything — crosses the window at a size that
 * is arithmetic. The axis has to stay under it *forever*, and the only honest
 * place to find out is a test that builds a corpus far past anything anybody has
 * tried by hand. Five hundred notes is that number here: it is well beyond the
 * point where a flat file has failed, and it is cheap enough to run on every
 * commit.
 *
 * If this file goes red, the axis does not ship. That is the whole point of
 * writing it before the pipeline that would depend on it.

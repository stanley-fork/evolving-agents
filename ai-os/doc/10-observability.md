## What was measured **[ran]**

2026-08-04, on the target harness rather than a proxy: `HARNESS=pi`,
`deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` via OpenRouter, in-process through `app.turn`.
**22 turns, all `ok`** — three tasks standing in for three kinds of flow step: a
planning step (which files must change), an eval step (a one-word verdict), and a
tool step (a command run in the sandbox). Each repeated from an identical starting
state on a fresh thread. Scripts: `ai-flows/scripts/delta-probe.ts` and
`delta-report.ts`, the latter importing the same functions this document describes,
so the report cannot drift from the implementation it reports on.

| Fingerprint taken over | δ pooled | C(δ) | (1−δ)³ |
|---|---|---|---|
| raw reply text | **21.1%** | 0.604 | 49.1% |
| normalized text | **0%** | 1.000 | 100% |
| extracted payload | **0%** | 1.000 | 100% |

**Every divergence was presentation.** The worst group was the planning step, raw
δ = 53.6% — and the entire difference was that the model wrote ``​`src/types.ts`​``
five times and `src/types.ts` three times. Backticks. Under normalization the
groups collapse to one value each: `src/types.ts` 8/8, `YES` 8/8, `a-b-c` 6/6.

**Zero observed is not zero.** With 8+8+6 samples the 95% upper bound on δ is
**14.6%**, so detection at *w* = 3 is at worst **62.3%** — comfortably above the 5%
floor at which the instrument stops seeing stuck flows. The module survives its
first falsification test, and it survives it at the pessimistic end of the interval
rather than only at the point estimate.

### What it changed

`digestOf` now normalizes before hashing. It did not before, and shipping it that
way would have carried 21% noise into every comparison for no gain — the raw bytes
were measuring prose style, not work. The backtick case is now a regression test
with the measured data in the comment.

### What this does not establish

Stated because the result is clean enough to be over-read.

1. **The tasks were terse by instruction** — "file paths only", "exactly one
   word". A discursive `Open` step has far more room to vary, and δ over one of
   those is unmeasured. This number is honest for *structured* observations, which
   is what `Observation.digest` should be taken over anyway, and optimistic for
   anything else.
2. **The eval task had an unambiguous answer**, and all 8 turns found it. A
   borderline verdict is where an eval fingerprint would actually be tested.
3. **δ is harness-dependent by definition.** This is one model on one harness. A
   different model, or `claude`/`codex`, needs its own number, which is why the
   probe is a committed script rather than a paragraph.

## The question this asks that the others do not

Every shape in [03](03-ai-flows.md) has a *Fails when*. `Open`'s is the vaguest
and the most common: *"the goal has not moved across N steps — drift, not
failure."*

That sentence hides two different problems wearing one symptom:

- **Drift.** The flow is legible and it is not moving. More steps might help.
- **Unreadable.** Whether it is moving cannot be told from what it records. More
  steps definitely will not help — the instrument is wrong.

Collapsing them is the same mistake as collapsing `waiting` and `blocked`, one
level down. A system that cannot tell *stuck* from *unmeasured* will answer
"still working on it" forever, and be right in the only sense it can check.

## Why this is a measurement problem, not a design one

To say "it has not moved" you must compare the state after attempt *n* with the
state after attempt *n+1*. Run two attempts of the *same* work from the *same*
starting state and the model will not necessarily produce the same thing twice.
So the comparison has a false-change rate, and every claim built on it inherits
that rate.

Call it **δ**: the probability that identical work yields a different
fingerprint.

The comparison is a binary observation, but not a symmetric one:

```
state unchanged ──(1−δ)──▶ same fingerprint
                ──( δ )──▶ different          ← noise
state changed   ──( 1 )──▶ different
```

Nothing manufactures a *repeat*. Non-determinism manufactures *differences*.
Hence the asymmetry that shapes the whole module:

> **A repeat is proof. A difference is a rumour.**

This is a Z-channel. Its capacity, in bits per comparison:

$$C(\delta) = \log_2\left(1 + (1-\delta)\,\delta^{\frac{\delta}{1-\delta}}\right)$$

$C(0) = 1$: a perfect instrument. $C(1) = 0$: one that reports "different"
whatever happens, and therefore reports nothing. Note $C(0.5) = \log_2 1.25
\approx 0.32$ — a *symmetric* channel would be dead at a coin-flip error rate,
and this one is not. The asymmetry is worth something, and it is the part worth
keeping.

## The curve that decides whether any of this is worth running

A stuck flow has exactly one way to announce itself: repeating its fingerprint.
Noise breaks repeats. So the probability of ever noticing one, over a window of
$w$ attempts, is

$$P(\text{caught}) = (1-\delta)^w$$

| δ | 0.0 | 0.1 | 0.2 | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.8 | 0.9 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| $C(\delta)$ bits | 1.000 | 0.763 | 0.618 | 0.504 | 0.322 | 0.114 | 0.055 |
| $(1-\delta)^3$ | 1.000 | 0.729 | 0.512 | 0.343 | 0.125 | **0.008** | 0.001 |

<sub>Both curves are computed, not drawn — the values come straight from <code>channelCapacity</code> and <code>detectionProbability</code>.</sub>

At δ = 0.8, roughly eight stuck flows in a thousand are ever seen. A flow can be
dead for a week while the system reports progress, and **waiting longer makes it
worse, because waiting is what the noise destroys.**

That is the argument for measuring δ before building anything on top of it, and
it is the argument this document is here to make.

## What the module does

`observabilityOf(digests, { floor })` takes the fingerprints of successive
attempts and δ, and returns one of four verdicts. It reports; it decides nothing.

| Verdict | Meaning | The right response |
|---|---|---|
| `insufficient` | fewer observations than the window | none — not a finding |
| `drift` | fingerprints repeating | the flow is legible and stopped. Escalate or redirect |
| `progressing` | fingerprints moving, **and** a stuck flow would have been caught | let it run |
| `unreadable` | δ is high enough that a stuck flow would look exactly like this | fix the fingerprint, not the step count |

The order of the checks carries the asymmetry: a repeat is trusted **whatever δ
is**, because noise only ever manufactures difference. Only the *absence* of a
repeat is something a noisy instrument cannot be trusted about.

Every verdict carries δ, the detection probability and the capacity with it, so a
verdict is never read without the number that bounds it.

## The second axis, and why it is not an ADR yet

Observability answers *can it be seen*. It does not answer *can it be moved*, and
those failures want different people.

Controllability is always relative to a **named** input set. Upstream offers
exactly two — `abort` and `steer` (`run-signal-store.ts:3` **[read]**) — plus
whatever a flow engine adds. A controllability claim that does not name its
inputs describes a system that does not exist.

|  | **Controllable** | **Not controllable** |
|---|---|---|
| **Observable** | `autonomous` — it runs | `escalate` — visibly stuck, no available input reaches it. Ask a person for something *specific* |
| **Not observable** | `instrument` — steering blind. Fix the recording | `abandon` — and record which half was missing |

`quadrantOf` computes this. **Nothing consumes it.** It is not wired into
`FLOW_STATES` and there is no ADR proposing that it should be, because the
proposition — that these four cells describe real work — has not been tested. The
function exists so the claim can be measured, not so it can be assumed. Compare
[ADR-0007](adr/0007-observation-captured-not-derived.md), which *is* an ADR
because upstream forced the decision and left no alternative.

## How this gets falsified

**Two measurements, in order. The first can kill the whole document in an
afternoon.**

**1 · Is δ small enough to work with?** Run the same piece of work from the same
starting state, repeatedly, on `pi`. Record fingerprints. Compute δ with
`divergenceRate`.

- **δ near 1 — the fingerprint never repeats.** Then `(1-\delta)^w \approx 0`, no
  stuck flow is ever detected, and every verdict this module can produce is
  `unreadable`. **Delete the module.** The finding is still worth publishing: it
  says agent state is not fingerprintable by the method tried, which constrains
  every drift-detection scheme anyone builds next, including the ones that never
  measured it.
- **δ small.** The module is usable and measurement 2 becomes meaningful.

An open choice inside this experiment: **what the fingerprint is over.** Files
touched is cheapest. Free text will be dominated by phrasing noise, and that is
itself a result. Whichever is used gets recorded in `Observation.source`, so two
flows are never compared across incompatible instruments.

**2 · Does the drift / unreadable split describe anything real?** Across real
`Open` flows, count the stuck ones landing in each verdict.

**If every stuck flow turns out to be `drift`,** the split is a distinction
without a difference — **delete this document rather than defend it**, and keep
`Open`'s original one-line rule.

**Portability:** everything here reads fingerprints off sequential attempts. No
subagents, no parallelism, no harness-specific machinery. It runs on `pi`
([03 § The portability constraint](03-ai-flows.md#the-portability-constraint)).

## What this is not

- **Not a convergence gate.** It never refuses to start a flow and never derives
  a budget. It answers whether a flow can be watched.
- **Not a score.** `Observation.digest` answers *can these be told apart*, which
  is defined for every shape. `Observation.value` answers *by how much*, and is
  `null` everywhere today because no shape declares a metric — `Loop` will, in
  M6, and the same machinery gains resolution without changing shape.
- **Not filtering.** Detrending, passbands and differencing over a numeric
  signal are for when there *is* a numeric signal. Until then δ is the whole of
  the content, and it is the load-bearing part.

# ai-os modifications to ai-base

<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT -->

`ai-base/` is vendored QM (MIT). This file is the complete list of every change
ai-os has made inside it.

**Why this file exists.** It is the conflict-resolution map for
`git subtree pull`. Without it, every upstream pull is an archaeology exercise.
[ADR-0001](../doc/adr/0001-fork-vs-dependency.md) accepts a permanent merge
burden; this file is what makes that burden survivable.

**Rules**

1. Everything under `ai-base/` is **MIT**, including our own additions, so that
   patches stay eligible to go upstream without a per-patch relicense. See
   [`doc/06-licensing.md`](../doc/06-licensing.md).
2. Never edit or delete `ai-base/LICENSE`.
3. Prefer not modifying at all — build against a seam
   ([`doc/01-architecture.md`](../doc/01-architecture.md)). Every line here is a
   line merged by hand forever.
4. If you must, make the smallest possible widening and record it below **in the
   same commit**.

### Do not use the bundled fork skills as-is

QM ships `.claude/skills/update-qm` and `.claude/skills/upstream-pr` for private
forks. **Both assume the repository root is qm** and dispatch on `git remote -v`.
Under our subtree, qm's root is `ai-base/` and `origin` is not a qm fork, so both
misread the situation. Use `git subtree pull` above instead.

Their _content_ still applies and should be read before any upstream push:

- **Merge, never rebase.** Published history is tracked by other clones.
- **Nothing under `deploy/layers/` reaches upstream** — not config, not infra
  coordinates, not the names of systems or people inside them.
- **An upstream push is permanent.** It stays reachable by SHA in every clone and
  fork even after a deleted branch or a force-push. Scrub before pushing, not
  after.

### Where ai-os deployment material goes

`deploy/layers/evolvingagents/` — QM's sanctioned location for org-specific
deployment config, sandbox tools, org plugin images and infrastructure. Generate
it with `qm init` rather than hand-building, so the `.gitignore` that keeps
`.env` and Terraform state out of Git comes with it:

```bash
node cli/bin/qm.ts init deploy/layers/evolvingagents --org evolvingagents --target fly
```

This directory is org material, never upstreamed, and `ai-ui` ships as a plugin
under it.

## Pull checklist

Run after every pull, before committing the merge:

- [ ] Every entry in the ledger below still applies, or is removed with a reason
- [ ] `SCOPE_KINDS` in `src/types.ts` still carries `flow` and `system`
      ([ADR-0003](../doc/adr/0003-storage-scope-axis.md))
- [ ] Every upstream `switch` over `ScopeKind` still handles the new kinds —
      **and any that falls through to a `default` fails closed, not open.**
      TypeScript will not catch that one; `test/scope-kind-fail-closed.test.ts`
      does, and its union census is what forces a widening to be handled rather
      than inherited. Run it first after every pull.
- [ ] `MemoryService` (`src/memory/memory-service.ts`) interface unchanged, or
      `ai-storage` updated
- [ ] `MemoryStrategyKind` in `src/memory/strategy.ts` still carries `dream`, and
      `KNOWN_KINDS` in `scripts/memory-bench.ts` still lists it. Upstream owns
      both lists; a pull that rewrites either drops an arm of the experiment in
      [05](../doc/05-ai-storage.md#experiment-1--distil-at-rest-memory_strategydream)
      silently, because nothing fails when a benchmark simply stops running a row
- [ ] `Harness` (`src/harness/harness.ts`) interface unchanged, or `ai-flows`
      updated
- [ ] Plugin chassis contract unchanged, or `ai-ui` updated
- [ ] `ai-base/LICENSE` still present and byte-identical
- [ ] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` **at the repository root** still runs the jobs we
      depend on. GitHub reads only the root `.github/workflows`, so
      `ai-base/.github/` is inert here: upstream can add, rename or fix a CI job
      and nothing about it reaches us. Ours is a deliberate subset — scope guard,
      typecheck, five test shards, Postgres, lint, ledger — and it drops
      upstream's CLI and plugin-image jobs, which cover code ai-os does not
      modify. Postgres is in because `test/postgres-store.test.ts` skips itself
      without `DATABASE_URL`, and it is the only place the run store's
      one-running-per-session claim is exercised — the constraint
      [03](../doc/03-ai-flows.md#the-concurrency-constraint) builds on.
- [ ] `package-lock.json` still byte-identical to the vendored one. A stray local
      `npm install` is the easiest unrecorded divergence to create and the least
      visible; the ledger job catches the commit, not the habit.

A markdown definition can, and it needs no new plumbing: `ToolContext.read`/`write` already reach the workspace, so an agent can read and rewrite its own agents                                                                                                                                                                 | **Yes** — additive, no core behaviour changes                                                                 | not sent |
| 2026-08-05 | `src/harness/pi-tools.ts`                                     | `delegate` tool, plus `runChild` and `childTools` options. The tool exists only when the harness supplies `runChild`; `childTools` filters by name and composes with the existing `readOnly` filter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | `pi` is the only harness that reaches OpenRouter and the only one with **no subagents** — the other three borrow the delegation of the CLI they wrap, which speaks only to its own vendor. That is why M1 found subagents and cheap models disjoint, and it is accidental rather than fundamental. A child is built without `runChild`, so it has no `delegate`: the tree is bounded at one level by construction, not by instruction                                                                                                      | **Yes** — qm wants subagents on `pi` as much as we do                                                         | not sent |

## Additions that are not modifications

Two files were **added** under `ai-base/`, and nothing upstream was changed. They
are recorded here anyway because the ledger check is keyed to the directory rather
than to the kind of change, and because an addition upstream did not make is still
something a subtree pull has to reconcile.

| `test/memory-bench/conversations/supersession-storm.json`    | The bench discovers fixtures from `readdirSync` over its own directory (`scripts/memory-bench.ts`), so a fixture outside it is invisible to the harness.

| `test/memory-bench/conversations/long-horizon-eviction.json` | Same reason. The second half of the gate — one policy revised once, far later, buried under volume. Baseline scored **3.0**, which is what opened M4                                                                                                                                       | [08 § M4](../doc/08-roadmap.md) |

**These should go upstream rather than stay ours.** They are fixtures for
upstream's own benchmark, they exercise a property that benchmark did not cover,
and they are useful to qm whether or not `ai-storage` is ever built. Added to the
send list below.

## Sending things upstream — two channels, and picking the wrong one is the mistake

**Vulnerabilities go privately.** `SECURITY.md` is explicit: report through the
repository's **Security → Report a vulnerability** flow, and _"do not open a
public issue, discussion, or pull request with exploit details."_ A public
`adrs/` PR describing an authorization bypass is a disclosure, not a
contribution.

**Everything else goes as informal human text.** `CONTRIBUTING.md` asks for a
`.txt` or `.md` file in `adrs/`, _"quite informal — just run your idea by us in
the same way you would a coworker"_, and adds: **"Please do not have AI
artificially expand what you'd like to do into a formal proposal."** A polished
generated document is the wrong artifact here even when the idea is right.

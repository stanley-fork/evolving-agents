"""Manifests, hashes and the hash-chained ledger. Spec §6.3 and §8.

Every artefact transition appends one line to `ledger.jsonl`, and each line
carries the hash of the line before it. That is the whole mechanism: to alter a
past entry you must rewrite every entry after it, so tampering is not prevented
but it is **not silent**, which is the property an audit trail actually needs.

The verifier is deliberately not in this module. `verify_ledger.py` at the
project root re-derives the chain from the files with nothing but the standard
library, so checking the ledger never runs the code that wrote it -- the same
independence rule §6.4 imposes between `truth/` and `src/`.

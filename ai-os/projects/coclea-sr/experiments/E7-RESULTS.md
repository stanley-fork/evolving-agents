# E7 (§7.4) — the explorer:verifier ratio bought nothing, and we should have known

**Run `runs/e7-ratio-0d94334574ea`, 2026-08-17. `qwen/qwen3.8-27b` against a live
`ai-os`. Ten flows, forty agent claims, ~$1.**

## The result

| arm | n | accuracy | dissent per verifier | corrections | mean $ | mean s |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5:1 | 3 | **100%** | 0% | 0/0 | 0.1487 | 470 |
| 2:1 | 4 | **100%** | 0% | 0/0 | 0.0555 | 268 |
| 1:1 | 3 | **100%** | 0% | 0/0 | 0.1228 | 292 |

**Null.** Verification bought nothing, because there was nothing to buy. Every
arm was already right.

`corrections` is `0/0` and the denominator is the finding: it counts flows where
the explorers' median was wrong to begin with, which is the only place
verification can demonstrate its worth. That never happened once.

## What the agents actually said

Forty claims. Ground truth **1.016**, tolerance ±0.25:

    5:1  1.0027 … 1.0130
    2:1  1.0036 … 1.0366
    1:1  1.0029 … 1.0104

The **entire spread across every agent in the experiment is 0.034**, against a
tolerance of 0.25 — seven times narrower than the band that would have counted as
correct. Nobody was near being wrong.

## The one retraction, and why it is not one

`2:1 rep 1` is the only flow flagged as a retraction in the whole run. A verifier
said **WRONG** in prose and then produced **1.0366**, which agrees with the
explorers' 1.0102 to within 0.026 — a tenth of the tolerance.

So the flag came from the word and not from the number. The unbiased metric
(`dissent per verifier`, one roll per verifier rather than one per
explorer-verifier pair) reports **0%** for that arm, and the biased one reports
25%. This is exactly the divergence `e7_analyse.py` was written to expose, and it
turns out to matter on the only positive case in the run:

> **A verifier that says "WRONG" and then agrees numerically has not retracted
> anything.** It has produced prose that a metric keyed to prose will count.

## Why the experiment came out empty — and it is our own rule

The task was chosen to be error-prone in a documented way. `lumped-full-cell` is
second order in the interior and first order at the free end; every docstring in
`assembly.py` says "second order" about the interior stencil. An explorer that
**reasons from the code** answers 2. One that **measures** answers 1.

Forty out of forty measured. Given an `execute` tool, this model does not reason
from docstrings — it runs the sweep.

That is a real and mildly encouraging finding about the model and the harness. It
is also a fatal one for the experiment, and the rule we broke is written in our
own `CLAUDE.md`:

> **Check headroom before building the treatment, never after.** If the baseline
> already sits at the ceiling, no treatment can move it and every arm ties —
> which reads as a success.

Every arm tied. The baseline sat at the ceiling. **One cheap control arm, run
before the other two were bought, would have said so** — and the file that says
to do that is the file this experiment was designed under. Writing a rule down is
not the same as applying it.

## What is not reported, and why

**No cost curve — and the reason is worse than the one first given here.**

The three means are `0.1487 / 0.0555 / 0.1228`, not monotone in verifier count,
with a within-arm spread (`0.0254` to `0.2173` on equivalent flows) larger than
any difference between arms. That was the original reason to withhold them.

[E9](e9_cost_attribution.py) then measured the instrument, and the real reason is
that **the numbers are not this project's spend at all**. A single flow was run
that completed successfully with a model call in 21 seconds, and both cost
endpoints moved by **exactly 0.0**. Probing once a minute afterwards:

    t+60s … t+300s   436.421299226   (unchanged)
    t+360s           436.422765086   (moved)

**OpenRouter's account counter lags by five to six minutes.** Every E7 flow took
221–562 seconds and its cost was read immediately after it finished, so each
delta was picking up *the previous flow's* spend, not its own. The figures are
misattributed rather than merely noisy.

Nothing that depends on a per-flow dollar figure ships from this project until
the accounting is done from generation records, which are attributable by
construction. The three means above are kept, struck through by this paragraph,
because deleting them would hide that they were published-adjacent for a day.

**No recommendation about ratios.** A null on one task at one difficulty is not
evidence that verification is worthless; it is evidence that this task could not
detect it.

## Two harness defects the run found, which is what the workload is for

Neither is about the ratio, and both were only findable under live load:

* **A flow could wait forever.** An attempt sat `running` for **3,316 seconds**
  while the flow reported `waiting` — the same state a healthy flow reports.
  Fixed with a stale-attempt reaper (`staleAttemptMs`), three tests.
* **The price tag destroyed the measurement.** A transient DNS failure on the
  cost endpoint raised out of `spend_so_far` at the line *after* a flow had
  finished, discarding a measured answer because its price could not be read. The
  probe now retries and then returns `null`; the row keeps its answer, and the
  summary reports `n_priced` beside `n` so a mean is never quietly computed over
  a smaller set than it claims.

The first cost an hour of wall clock. The second cost four flows and about $0.40.
Both are the kind of thing a workload with an oracle finds and a prose task never
generates.

## What would actually answer §7.4

A task where the plausible answer is wrong **and the model reaches for it**. This
one failed the second half. The candidate is a level-3 style diagnosis: not
*"measure this number"* but *"this result is wrong, find out why"* — where the
explorer has to locate a defect rather than run a sweep, and where measuring is
not available as an escape.

Before buying any arm of that, run **one** flow of the plainest configuration and
check that it fails often enough to leave room. That is the control this run
should have started with.

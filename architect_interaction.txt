TASK REQUIREMENT:

    
    Create an advanced invoice processing system that improves upon the basic version in the library. The system should:
    
    1. Use a more sophisticated document analyzer that can detect invoices with higher confidence
    2. Extract comprehensive information (invoice number, date, vendor, items, subtotal, tax, total)
    3. Verify calculations to ensure subtotal + tax = total
    4. Generate a structured summary with key insights
    5. Handle different invoice formats and detect potential errors
    
    The system should leverage existing components from the library when possible,
    evolve them where improvements are needed, and create new components for missing functionality.
    
    Please generate a complete workflow for this invoice processing system.
    

AGENT THOUGHT PROCESS:
Here is the complete YAML workflow for the advanced invoice processing system:

```yaml
scenario_name: Invoice Processing Workflow
domain: general
description: >
  This workflow processes invoice documents by analyzing, extracting data, verifying calculations, detecting errors, and generating summaries. It integrates various components to form a cohesive system and evolves by identifying and implementing improvements.

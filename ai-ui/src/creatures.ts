/**
 * How many of an agent there are, and what each one is doing.
 *
 * The desk used to draw one cube per agent, placed by the layout. That could
 * only ever say an agent was in *one* place, so an agent holding steps in two
 * flows was drawn standing on whichever one the layout named — the picture said
 * "it is here", the trace said "it is in both", and people believe the picture.
 *
 * These three rules replace that: an agent is **one creature per document it has
 * work in**, derived from the steps rather than from where somebody once dropped
 * a cube. Several steps in one document stay one creature with a multiplier,
 * because five queued steps is one agent with a queue, not five agents.
 *
 * ## Why this is a string
 *
 * It runs in the page, which has no build step and no imports — the same
 * constraint [simulate.ts](simulate.ts) and [mascot.ts](mascot.ts) live under.
 * It is kept out of `desk.ts` so that [test/creatures.test.ts](../test/creatures.test.ts)
 * can **execute the shipped source** and call these functions directly, rather
 * than assert that some substring appears in the HTML. Rules the render depends
 * on should be checked by running them.
 */
/**
 * The body every agent has, in one place.
 *
 * There used to be two of these. The mascot was a 26px body with 4×6 eyes and
 * four legs; an agent on the desk was a 15px body with 2×4 eyes and three legs
 * carved out of its bottom edge as notches. Both were "the cube with eyes" in
 * the source and neither was in the picture: a reader saw a character and a row
 * of chips, which is precisely the mascot-bolted-on failure the whole design was
 * supposed to avoid. Two sprites means two species however the comment reads.
 *
 * So: one sprite, drawn on a 16-pixel grid and scaled by `--u`. The system agent
 * is `--u:2` — the same animal at twice the size, which is what "the cube at
 * twice the size" was always meant to mean. Every coefficient below is a whole
 * number of grid units, so both sizes land on whole pixels and nothing blurs.
 *
 * `--ex` / `--ey` are where the eyes are pointing. One implementation aims every
 * creature on the desk, mascot included ([desk.ts](desk.ts)) — the alternative
 * was a mascot that watches you and agents that stare through you.

/**
 * The cochlea project in mid-development — memory, a falsification, and work in flight.
 *
 * ## What this adds to the scope that was already there
 *
 * [`cochlea-demo.ts`](cochlea-demo.ts) shows two chains, both green, one wrong,
 * separated by a gate. That is an argument about a **result**.
 *
 * This file is the argument about a **project**: what the desk looks like while
 * one is being built rather than at the moment one is judged. Three flows, and
 * each is a different thing a research project actually does.
 *
 * 1. **The falsification.** The flow whose output was not a result but a
 *    *decision*. It is `blocked`, it will never be unblocked, and the artefact
 *    it produced — ADR-0002 — is the reason the project has a therapeutic
 *    surface at all. A desk that only shows work succeeding cannot show this.
 * 2. **Work in flight.** GATE-D1, mid-run. Steps done, one running, two pending.
 *    A project is mostly this and almost never the moment it freezes.
 * 3. **Memory over the project's own history.** The memory agents indexing the
 *    decision record, using the product's real `addNote`, `verifyNote` and
 *    `lint` — the same mechanics `group:memory-lab` runs, pointed at a corpus
 *    that has something `memory-lab`'s does not: **a time axis**.
 *
 * ## The finding, and why it is one level up from `memory-lab`
 *
 * `memory-lab`'s defect is mechanical. A note claims 663 characters of a passage
 * that is 1,105, so following its range lands on different words, and
 * `verifyNote` catches it because a range either matches or does not.
 *
 * The defect here passes **every** mechanical check. `n-adr-0001` records
 * ADR-0001 accurately: the range matches the text, the hash is of what was read,
 * it sits inside the window, it has keywords and ideas, its summary does not
 * repeat its title. `verifyNote` returns clean. `lint` returns clean. A reader
 * asking the index *"how does the place code work"* gets a correct summary of a
 * decision **that was reversed three days later**.
 *
 * Nothing about the note is wrong. What is wrong is that a corpus of decisions
 * is not a pile of facts — the later ones overrule the earlier ones, and an
 * index that flattens that is confidently out of date.
 *
 * So the check is not a stricter `verifyNote`. It is a different question:
 *
 *     a note whose source declares itself superseded must link to a note
 *     covering the document that superseded it
 *
 * The superseding fact lives in the **source** — ADR-0001's own status line says
 * so — never in the note, because a note that had to declare its own staleness
 * would be a note that already knew. That is the whole point of the failure:
 * the writer got everything it could see right.
 *
 * ## It is the product's rule now, not this file's
 *
 * The first version of this scope carried its own implementation, because
 * `ai-flows` had no check for it. That is the wrong place for a finding: a demo
 * with a private instrument is a demo measuring itself.
 *
 * So `lint` in [`wiki.ts`](../../ai-flows/src/wiki.ts) gained the rule, the fact
 * travels on `Provenance.supersededBy`, and this file now **filters the
 * product's output** rather than computing anything. The scope's argument is
 * unchanged and its history is the interesting part: the index passed every
 * check the product had, and the product acquired one.
 *
 * `test/cochlea-project.test.ts` asserts it in both directions. Give the note
 * its link and the check goes green; that is what makes the red one a
 * measurement rather than a decoration.

/**
 * A research project on the desk — the fourth scope in the demo.
 *
 * ## Why a cochlea, and what it argues that the other scopes do not
 *
 * The signal lab ([dsp-demo.ts](dsp-demo.ts)) makes the claim that **green is
 * not correct**: a step runs, settles, reports, and carried nothing. That is a
 * claim about a step.
 *
 * This scope makes the claim one step up, about a *result*. Two flows, the same
 * eight agents, the same six steps, **both entirely green**, both producing
 * eigenvalues that are ordered, orthogonal, and have the right number of zeros.
 * One of them is wrong in every number it reports. Nothing in the trace
 * separates them, and nothing in the prose does either — the two reports differ
 * by one word.
 *
 * What separates them is a **gate**: an external oracle, declared before the run,
 * that the flow is measured against. The correct chain freezes. The other is
 * held at `blocked`, and the desk can say which gate stopped it and what the
 * number was.
 *
 * That is the mechanism `ai-flows` was missing, in its own words —
 * [`types.ts`](../../ai-flows/src/types.ts) says a metric is *"defined only
 * where a shape declares a metric, and today no shape does"*. A cochlea
 * declares one, because the eigenvalues of a fixed-free string have a closed
 * form and being close to it is not a matter of opinion.
 *
 * ## Everything here is computed, and computed independently
 *
 * The numbers are produced at build time by the eigensolver below: a symmetric
 * tridiagonal Sturm bisection, about eighty lines, no dependencies. It is a
 * **third implementation** of the same problem, next to `truth/` (sympy and
 * mpmath, closed form) and `src/coclea/` (numpy and scipy, LAPACK).
 *
 * That is not duplication for its own sake. The cochlea specification §6.2
 * requires that the verifier not share code with the constructor, and a
 * different language is the strongest form of that independence available for
 * the price. `test/cochlea-demo.test.ts` asserts these numbers against the ones
 * the Python suite recorded, so the demo cannot drift from the project and the
 * project cannot drift from the demo: if they disagree, one of them is wrong and
 * the build says so.
 *
 * ## The defect, and why it is this one
 *
 * The membrane is discretised in flux form, and the node at the apex — the
 * helicotrema — owns **half a cell**. The broken chain gives it a whole one.
 * That is an `O(dx)` error in the total mass and therefore in every eigenvalue,
 * and it is invisible to almost everything: the matrix stays symmetric, the mass
 * stays positive, the spectrum stays ordered, every mode keeps exactly the right
 * number of zeros. The naive sanity check on a mass matrix — does it integrate
 * to the continuum mass — actually **prefers the broken one**, which sums to
 * exactly 1.0 while the correct one sums to `1 - dx/2`.
 *
 * Two gates do see it, and they say different things. GATE-A01 says **how far
 * off**: 2.592e-4 against a tolerance of 1.0e-4. GATE-A12 says **where**: order
 * 0.9996 instead of 2, and first order is a boundary error — the free end, which
 * is the helicotrema. The gate that trips first is not the gate that localises,
 * and a suite that only had the first one would have reported a wrong number
 * with no idea which line produced it.

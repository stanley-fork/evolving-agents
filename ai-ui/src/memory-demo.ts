/**
 * A knowledge base being built, on the desk — the third scope in the demo.
 *
 * ## What this scope is for
 *
 * The other two scopes show a flow *running*. This one shows a flow **reading**:
 * the memory agents turning a heap of material into something a small window can
 * navigate. It is the same desk, the same digest, the same trace and the same
 * "carried nothing forward" flag — pointed at the one job where the material is
 * the problem rather than the work.
 *
 * The project is invented and says so. Nothing here is a customer, and the flows
 * are the shape a real ingest has rather than a recording of one.
 *
 * ## Why the numbers are computed rather than written
 *
 * Every note below goes through `ai-flows`' real `addNote`, so the sharding, the
 * index cards and the budget are the product's, not a drawing of them. The two
 * flows differ in exactly one way and it is the way that matters:
 *
 * - **The index that was built** — every step verified, every note inside the
 *   window, `lint` clean.
 * - **The index that drifted** — one note whose source range does not match the
 *   text it hashed. It looks exactly like the others in the list, because that
 *   is the point: it was written by a model that got the judgement right and the
 *   mechanics wrong, and nothing complained.
 *
 * A person reading the desk should be able to find the second one, and the only
 * thing that makes it findable is that code checked something a reader cannot
 * see. That is the argument this scope exists to make.

/**
 * A signal chain on the desk — the second scope in the demo.
 *
 * ## Why a signal chain, of all things
 *
 * The desk's whole claim is that **green is not correct**: a step can run,
 * settle, report, and have carried nothing forward. On a flow of prose that
 * claim is real and hard to feel, because the reader has to take the
 * instrument's word for it. On a signal chain it is a picture. A waveform goes
 * in, a fixed-point conversion with the scale entered wrong truncates every
 * sample to zero, and each downstream stage runs happily on nothing and reports
 * success. The flow ends green, with a confident answer — bin 0, magnitude 0.00
 * — and the evidence is a flatline anybody can see.
 *
 * Two flows, the same six agents, the same six steps, both entirely green. One
 * found the tone at 5 Hz; the other lost it at step 2 and never noticed.
 * **Nothing in the desk knows what a Fourier transform is**: the same digest,
 * the same trace, the same mascot and the same "carried nothing forward" flag do
 * all of the work. That is the argument — the instruments are not about text.
 *
 * ## Everything here is computed, not written
 *
 * The numbers below come out of an actual notch filter and an actual radix-2
 * FFT, run at build time so the page stays byte-identical per build. Writing
 * plausible arrays by hand would have made this a drawing of an argument
 * instead of the argument.
 *
 * And the verdict on each handoff is **measured, not inferred**: every stage is
 * re-run with a perturbed input and the change in its output is compared to the
 * change in its input. A stage whose output does not move is flagged through the
 * same `contribution` field a real core would use ([trace.ts](trace.ts)).
 *
 * Prose overlap — the desk's usual instrument — would have passed the broken
 * stage without hesitating, and that is the point rather than a caveat. The two
 * reports differ by one number: "converted 64 samples to fixed point at 32767
 * counts per unit" against "…at 0.5 counts per unit". Every distinctive word
 * carries. It is the signal that is missing, not the vocabulary.

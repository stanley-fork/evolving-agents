/**
 * The canvas's server: state in, layout out, and two actions that cost money.
 *
 * It owns no flows and no conformation. Both come from `ai-flows`, over its
 * signed HTTP seam, for the reason
 * [ADR-0006](../../doc/adr/0006-ai-flows-lives-outside-core.md)
 * gives: a second process reaching into the first one's tables is a coupling
 * nobody can see and nobody can revoke. The canvas is a client.
 *
 * What it does own is the layout — because a per-scope arrangement is not flow
 * state and does not belong in the flow tables.
 *
 * ## Two routes spend model calls, and they say so
 *
 * `POST /assign` appends a delegation step. `POST /advance` runs one. Everything
 * else is a read. That split is deliberate: the desk polls itself every few
 * seconds, and a canvas where *rendering* could trigger work would spend money
 * because somebody left a tab open.
 *
 * Neither route decides on its own that a flow should proceed. The rule is the
 * same one `ai-flows` states: **advance is a click, by whoever owns the decision
 * to spend a model call.**

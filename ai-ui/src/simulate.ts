/**
 * The desk, running with nothing behind it.
 *
 * The website should let someone *use* the OS rather than read about it, and a
 * static page cannot reach a core, a flow API or a database. The obvious way to
 * get one is to build a mock-up of the desk. That is the wrong way, and the
 * reason is the failure mode this repository keeps finding: **a demo that is a
 * separate implementation stops being true within a week**, quietly, while
 * continuing to look right.
 *
 * So the demo is the real thing. `renderDeskHtml` ships one client, and that
 * client touches the network in exactly three places — `GET /state`,
 * `PUT /layout`, `POST /assign|/unassign|/advance`. This module replaces
 * `window.fetch` with an in-page implementation of those three, and changes
 * nothing else. Every drag, every stack, the panel, the trace face, the memory
 * drawer and the five-second poll are the code that runs against Postgres.
 *
 * **If the desk breaks, the demo breaks.** That is the property worth having,
 * and it is why this is a fetch shim rather than a mock-up.
 *
 * ## What is simulated, and what that costs
 *
 * The fake core answers a step with a canned reply after a short delay, so
 * "advance" produces movement without a model. That is the one place the demo
 * lies, and the page says so on its own chrome rather than in a caption.
 *
 * The traces it produces are real in shape and fabricated in content: digests
 * are stable strings rather than hashes of real output. A visitor watching
 * `drift — repeating itself` appear is seeing the true instrument reading
 * invented data.

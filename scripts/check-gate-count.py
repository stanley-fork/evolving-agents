"""The published gate count, checked against the reports that produce it.

`check-test-count.sh` exists because the test count drifted three times in one
week. The gate count then drifted the same way and nothing caught it: on
2026-08-23 thirteen places across seven files said **26 gates / 125 checks** while
`projects/coclea-sr/gates/reports/` held **28 gates / 135 checks**, and
`doc/PLAN.md` — written the same day the count changed — said 28/135 alone.

A rule applied to one number and not to the next one is a habit, not a check.

## What this verifies, and what it does not

It compares the *published claim* against the report artifacts on disk. It does
**not** re-run the suite: `make gates` is nine minutes and needs numpy, scipy
and sympy, so a check that ran it could not be a fast one. That means this
script inherits FRICTION F3 — a stale report is still a report — and
`gates/check_reports.py` is what guards against that. The two are complementary
and neither replaces the other.

It also refuses to answer if any report is unreadable or records a failure,
rather than reporting a smaller number that a broken suite would produce. A
check that degrades quietly is the failure mode `ai-flows/src/gates.ts` calls
out: "did not run" is not "passed".

"""Crystallization — freezing a fluid agent into a deterministic recipe.

While a commit is ``fluid`` it evolves probabilistically: models run at high
temperature, code and goals mutate between iterations. Once a sub-problem is
solved well enough, you ``freeze`` it. Crystallization:

  1. pins every model to deterministic decoding (temperature 0, top_p 1),
  2. extracts the message trace into an ordered, replayable recipe of steps,
  3. emits a human-readable artifact under ``crystal/<commit>.json``, and
  4. records a new ``crystallized`` commit whose parent is the fluid one.

The result is a frozen path that can be re-executed cheaply and predictably,
without burning tokens re-deriving a solution you already trust.

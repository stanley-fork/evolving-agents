"""Evolutionary diagnostics over the commit graph.

agentvcs is the only tool that stores an agent's *recorded lineage*: every
iteration as a commit, with an eval score attributed per commit. That makes it the
natural — and only — place to answer a question a plain VCS cannot: is the agent's
self-modification loop actually *improving*, or is it degrading faster than
selection can recover?

Three pure-function diagnostics, standard library only, computed over data agentvcs
already stores (the commit DAG in the object store + the eval side-table):

  * ``price``   — Price-equation decomposition. How much of the trait change came
    from **selecting between branches** (``Cov(w, z)``) versus **editing within a
    lineage** (``E[w·Δz]``), plus the Eigen error-catastrophe verdict: the crossing
    where within-lineage degradation overtakes the selection differential. Fitness
    ``w`` is offspring count — the textbook Price definition (how many children a
    commit spawned); the trait ``z`` is a commit's eval score (default), its spec
    size in files, or its recorded cost.
  * ``slowing`` — critical-slowing-down early warning. Rising lag-1 autocorrelation
    and variance in the eval-score series flag an approaching collapse *before* the
    mean moves (Scheffer 2009).
  * ``ratchet`` — Muller's-ratchet load on unmerged branches. A long asexual lineage
    accumulates deleterious edits it cannot purge without recombination (``merge``);
    this quantifies the case for merging a diverged branch back.

Every function degrades gracefully when there aren't enough eval'd commits and says
so (``insufficient: true``) rather than inventing a number.

Honesty caveats worth carrying in the output, not just the docs:
  * The Eigen threshold is sharp only on a single-peak landscape; on rugged
    landscapes it softens (Wiehe 1997). Read the crossing as an order-of-magnitude
    signal, not a cliff.
  * Slowing-down needs a real time series of scored commits to mean anything.

    Measured from the recorded traces agentvcs stores:
      * ``action_entropy_bits`` = H(A) over tool selections — the channel the agent
        actually exercises.
      * ``transition_mi_bits`` = I(previous action; next action) — a concrete,
        computable mutual information whose *context* variable is the preceding
        action. This is a **lower-bound proxy** for I(full context; action), not the
        whole thing; it is honest about what it measures.
      * ``bits_per_ktok`` = action entropy per thousand context tokens (from the
        current runtime frame, best-effort) — the compression-headroom signal.

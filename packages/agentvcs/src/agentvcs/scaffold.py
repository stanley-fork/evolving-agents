The behavior here is *cultivated*, not written once. It is versioned with
**agentvcs** (CLI `agentvcs`/`avcs`, plus the `agentvcs` skill and MCP server),
which tracks not just code but the **goal**, the **models**, and the **message
trace** of every iteration — and a per-commit **state** (`fluid` = evolving,
`crystallized` = frozen & deterministic).

## Convention for this project: version every iteration
Always pass `--json` (parseable; errors carry a stable `error.code`). If your
shell cwd is not sticky, use `-C <project-dir>` (like `git -C`).

1. `agent.json` declares this iteration's `goal`, `models`, and `trace` file —
   keep `goal` current and append agent messages to the trace as you work.
2. `agentvcs commit -m "what changed" --json` after each meaningful iteration.
3. `agentvcs diff --json` to see which dimension moved (code/goal/models/trace).
4. Regressed? `agentvcs rollback --json` restores the full prior state (reversible).
5. Trust a behavior? `agentvcs freeze --json` crystallizes it (temperature 0);
   `agentvcs replay --json` re-runs the frozen recipe deterministically.

Explore alternatives on a live branch: `agentvcs branch try-x && agentvcs checkout try-x`.

## Definition of done (project convention)
When the requested work passes its checks and you trust it, **`agentvcs freeze` it —
you don't need to ask first.** Freezing is non-destructive and reversible: it adds a
crystallized commit while the fluid history stays intact, so it's always safe to do.

description: Version this evolving agent project with agentvcs — commit code+goal+models+trace together, diff per dimension, rollback mistakes, freeze (crystallize) trusted behavior, and replay it deterministically.

# Versioning this project with agentvcs

This project is versioned with agentvcs, not (only) git. Each commit captures
**code + goal + models + trace** and a **state** (`fluid` / `crystallized`).

- Always pass `--json`. Errors are `{"ok": false, "error": {"code": "..."}}` —
  branch on the stable `code`.
- If your shell cwd isn't sticky, use `-C <dir>` (like `git -C`).

## Loop
```bash
# keep agent.json's goal current; append messages to the trace file as you work
agentvcs commit -m "what changed" --json   # after each meaningful iteration
agentvcs diff --json                        # which dimension moved?
agentvcs rollback --json                    # undo a regression (restores full prior state)
agentvcs freeze --json                      # crystallize a trusted behavior (temperature 0)
agentvcs replay --json                      # re-run a frozen recipe deterministically
```

MCP tools are also available (`avcs_commit`, `avcs_diff`, `avcs_rollback`,
`avcs_freeze`, `avcs_replay`, ...) returning the same `{"ok": ...}` JSON.

**Done = frozen.** When the work passes and you trust it, `agentvcs freeze` it
without asking — freezing is reversible (the fluid history stays).

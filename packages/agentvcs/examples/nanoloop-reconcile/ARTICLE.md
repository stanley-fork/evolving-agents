# Merging minds, not just code

### A smart `merge` for agentvcs — built *and* powered by nanoLoop

When a fleet of agents builds software, the hardest merge isn't the code. Git
merges *text*. But when two agent branches diverge, the thing that actually
matters — the **reasoning**: what each branch tried, what it learned, which
dead-ends it already burned tokens exploring — lives in the message trace, and
nothing merges that. The agent that picks up the merged branch inherits the
files but not the lessons. It re-derives, re-debates, and often re-walks a path a
sibling branch already proved was wrong. Working-memory amnesia.

This post is about closing that gap, and about two projects that fit together to
do it.

Both ideas here are **[Ismael Faro](https://github.com/ismaelfaro)'s**:

- **[agentvcs](https://github.com/EvolvingAgentsLabs/agentvcs)** — "git for
  agents." Version control where every commit captures four dimensions at once —
  **code, goal, models, and the message trace** — plus a state (`fluid` while the
  agent is still evolving, `crystallized` once you freeze a trusted, deterministic
  recipe). I'm working on implementing it at EvolvingAgentsLabs.
- **[nanoLoop](https://github.com/ismaelfaro/nanoLoop)** — a tiny autonomous
  engineering harness: **Plan → Build → Review → Test → Ship**, each phase a
  subagent with isolated context, sandboxed and gated.

The fun part: nanoLoop **built** this feature in agentvcs, and then became the
**brain that runs it**.

## What we added

agentvcs already stored a two-parent–capable commit model, so a real merge fit
without a schema change. Two features went in:

**1. `agentvcs merge <branch>` — a multidimensional, three-way merge.**
It finds the merge-base across the full parent DAG, does a line-level three-way
merge of the code (git-style conflict markers when hunks overlap), unions the
model pins, and writes a genuine two-parent merge commit.

**2. `agentvcs log --reasoning` — a decision-aware history.**
It reads goal transitions, eval verdicts, and a new *durable* rollback ledger
(`.agentvcs/rollbacks.jsonl`) and renders the commit history as a **decision
ledger**: what was attempted, what passed, what got rolled back and why. The
first thing a fresh agent should run, so it inherits hindsight instead of
repeating a predecessor's mistakes.

---

## The key design choice: mechanism vs. intelligence

agentvcs's whole promise is **zero runtime dependencies, pure Python stdlib,
fully auditable**. Reconciling two reasoning traces into one coherent narrative
is an inherently *LLM* job. Putting a model call inside agentvcs would break that
promise.

So the merge is split along the seam the project already uses for `replay --exec`:

- **agentvcs (the mechanism, deterministic):** finds the base, merges the code
  tree, unions models, and assembles a **reconciliation bundle** — base / ours /
  theirs goals + traces + code diffs + per-side eval/cost metrics + conflicts + the
  full text of any unresolved conflict. With no helper, it ships a deterministic
  fallback (a mechanical merge marker; both parent traces stay reachable, nothing is
  lost).
- **An external reconciler (the intelligence, probabilistic):** when you pass
  `--reconcile <CMD>`, agentvcs pipes the bundle to that process on stdin and reads
  back `{goal, trace, notes}` — optionally with **`resolved_files`**, the
  conflict-free code the reconciler synthesized, which agentvcs writes. The core
  never imports an LLM.

That `CMD` is where **nanoLoop plugs in** — it ships a first-class
`nanoloop reconcile` subcommand that reads the bundle on stdin and writes the
Consolidated Knowledge Trace on stdout, using its own OpenRouter model layer.

```
agentvcs merge feature-sql --reconcile "nanoloop reconcile nanoLoop/.env"
```

---

## Does it actually work? A worked example.

Two branches diverge from a stub `store()` for a refund-ticket router:

- **`feature-sql`** — chose SQL. Spent 15 turns getting a validated schema right.
  Trace records the win *and* the scar: *poor write throughput under burst; INSERTs
  serialize on the db lock.*
- **`feature-nosql`** — chose append-only NoSQL. Trace records: *excellent burst
  throughput, no lock* — and the gap: *no schema validation; malformed tickets get
  written.*

The code conflicts (both rewrote `store.py`). A normal merge stops there. But we
want the **minds** reconciled regardless, so we merge *through* the conflict
(`--force`) with nanoLoop as the reconciler:

```
agentvcs merge feature-sql --reconcile "nanoloop reconcile nanoLoop/.env" --force
```

Here is the Consolidated Knowledge Trace it wrote into the merge commit —
excerpted and trimmed for length (the run is fully reproducible from the example
in this folder):

> **Merged goal:** *Persist refund tickets durably with both schema validation and
> high write throughput.*

It didn't concatenate two chat logs. It **synthesized**: picked the winner per
concern, kept the lesson from the loser, and — crucially — wrote down the
dead-ends so the next agent won't re-explore them. That's the whole point.

## Status (honestly)

- Both features are implemented in agentvcs: **106 tests pass** (86 pre-existing,
  zero regressions, + 20 new).
- The merge, conflict markers, the freeze gate that blocks on unresolved
  conflicts, the `--reconcile` seam, and the decision-aware log are all
  smoke-tested end-to-end.
- nanoLoop ships a first-class **`nanoloop reconcile`** subcommand, so the merge
  command above works verbatim. (A from-scratch reference reconciler also lives in
  this folder, `reconcile.py`, for anyone who wants to wire a different brain.)
- Now done: **conflict-aware code synthesis.** The bundle carries the full
  base/ours/theirs text of every unresolved conflict, and the reconciler may return
  `resolved_files` — the conflict-free code it wrote — which agentvcs commits. The
  reconciler no longer just *reasons* about `store.py`; it can *resolve* it. (Two
  more dials landed alongside it: a `--target-goal` to direct the merge, and
  eval-score-weighted auto-select that breaks conflicts per-hunk before the LLM is
  asked.)
- Still a rendering gap: surfacing the *abandoned* commit's decision text in
  `log --reasoning` (the data is on disk; the renderer just doesn't show it yet).

The loop is satisfying: the harness that *builds* the merge is the same one that
*performs* the knowledge reconciliation. nanoLoop writes the mechanism; agentvcs
gives it a durable, multidimensional place to put the result.
